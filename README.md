# ✊✋✌️ Rock, Paper, Scissors – Python Console Game

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game. The player selects rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer randomly selects one as well. The winner is determined based on standard game rules.

## 🎮 How It Works

- The user is prompted to input a choice:
  - `0` for Rock  
  - `1` for Paper  
  - `2` for Scissors
- The computer randomly picks one of the three options.
- ASCII art visually displays both choices.
- The program then prints out the result:
  - Win 🎉
  - Lose ❌
  - Draw 🤝

## 🧠 Game Logic

- Rock beats Scissors  
- Scissors beats Paper  
- Paper beats Rock  

Invalid inputs result in an automatic loss.
